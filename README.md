# GPLM-BAR

In this GitHub respository, we provide the sample code to our novel approch for simulataneous variable selection and estimation under the context of Generalized Partly Linear Models (GPLM). In order to replicate our results, you would need to install the BrokenAdaptiveRidge package. To do this, run the following:

```{R}
install.packages("devtools")
install.packages("Cyclops")
install.packages("BrokenAdaptiveRidge")
```

We provide the sample code for the three scenarios (Scenario 1, Scenario 2 and Scenario 4) in our manuscript. For scenario 1, please refer to \textit{LPLMNEWn600p300.R}
